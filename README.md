# NLW-eSports

Hi, this project was made at #NextLevelWeek by https://www.rocketseat.com.br/.
Three simple apps were created, mobile frontend, web frontend and backend.

### To start the applications, initially open a terminal in the root folder of each one of them and type:

> npm install

### Once this is done just type the following commands in each project

Mobile: 
> npx expo start 
  or
> expo start

web and backend : 
> npm run dev

Many of the things presented I already knew, but it was fun.
I didn't improve their code because I didn't have time lol
